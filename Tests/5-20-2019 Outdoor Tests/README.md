## Outdoor Testing 5/21/2019

The results from the outdoor tests indicate no accuracy improvement from previous outdoor tests. Futhermore, no accuracy improvement was observed when a ground plane on top of the receiver rig or a reflector midway between the transmitter to the receiver was used. 

#### Results
Tests were conducted at 90, 45, 30, 15, and 0 degrees and the transmitter to receiver distance was 15 meters. Each angle was tested with a ground plane-no reflector (e.g "0_gp_no.txt"), ground plane-reflector (e.g. "0_gp_ref.txt"), no ground plane-no reflector (e.g. "0_no_no.txt"), and no ground-plane-reflector (e.g. "0_no.ref.txt") setup.
